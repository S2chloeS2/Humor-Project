Week 4: Mutating Data
Assignment
Due date
2/20/2026, 3:30:00 PM EST
In this assignment, you will extend your existing app from Assignment #3 by adding functionality that allows logged-in users to “rate” captions. This means users should be able to interact with captions and submit a vote (for example, upvote or downvote), and your app should store that vote in the database.


The key goal of this assignment is to practice mutating data, which means creating new rows in your database rather than just reading existing data. Specifically, when a user submits a vote, your app should insert a new row into the caption_votes table that records the user’s vote and associates it with the correct caption. Because mutating data requires authentication, you must ensure that only logged-in users are able to submit votes. If a user is not logged in, they should not be able to rate captions. Your app should use the authentication system you implemented previously to enforce this.


The purpose of this assignment is to help you understand how modern web apps allow users to create and modify data, not just display it.


Note: Please do not update/enable/disable any RLS policies in Supabase.


When you are finished, deploy your app to Vercel and submit the commit-specific URL of your deployment in the Submissions section.
