Extend your app from assignment #2. Update it so that it protects a given route and shows a gated UI.


Here’s our Google OAuth Client ID:


388960353527-fh4grc6mla425lg0e3g1hh67omtrdihd.apps.googleusercontent.com

The assignment can/should be done without a Google Client Secret.


Be sure that your redirect URI is /auth/callback in your application.


Make sure you are redirecting to /auth/callback, not any other route with any other query parameters.


I suggest using the following NodeJS packages:



@supabase/ssr (server/browser auth client wiring)

@supabase/supabase-js (Auth API calls)


Note: Please do not update/enable/disable any RLS policies in Supabase.


Submit the commit-specific URL of your Vercel app in the “Submissions” section.
